How to Play: You will first answer a question And
answer what type of error it is. The next section
have to fix the highlighted code and run it so it
mathces the output of the top text.

Score: Scoring is based on how many attempts on the
multiple choice and how long it takes to solve one 
problem. You are penalized for selecting multiple wrong
answers and for taking too long. The faster you can
answer a question correctly, the more points you get.

Compile Time Errors: Errors detected by the compiler before 
the program runs, usually due to syntax mistakes or type 
mismatches in the code.

    1. Syntax Errors
        - Missing semicolons (;), braces ({}), or 
          parentheses (()).

        - Example: System.out.println("Hello World"

    2. Class Not Found
        - Trying to use a class that isn’t imported or doesn’t 
          exist in the project.

        - Example: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
          without import java.util.Scanner;.

    3. Type Mismatch
        -Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another 
         incompatible type.

        -Example: int x = "Hello"; (String assigned to an int).
