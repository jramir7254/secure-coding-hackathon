  How to Play: You will first answer a question And answer what type of 
  error it is. The next section
  have to fix the highlighted code and run it so it
  mathces the output of the top text.

  Score: Scoring is based on how many attempts on the
  multiple choice and how long it takes to solve one 
  problem. You are penalized for selecting multiple wrong
  answers and for taking too long. The faster you can
  answer a question correctly, the more points you get.

  Compile Time Errors: Errors detected by the compiler before 
  the program runs, usually due to syntax mistakes or type 
  mismatches in the code.

      1. Syntax Errors
          - Missing semicolons (;), braces ({}), or 
            parentheses (()).

          - Example: System.out.println("Hello World"

      2. Class Not Found
          - Trying to use a class that isn’t imported or doesn’t 
            exist in the project.

          - Example: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
            without import java.util.Scanner;.

      3. Type Mismatch
          -Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another 
          incompatible type.

          -Example: int x = "Hello"; (String assigned to an int).

  Runtime Error/Exceptions: Errors that occur while the program is executing, 
  often caused by invalid operations like dividing by zero or accessing out-of-bound array elements.

      1. NullPointerException
          - Cause: Attempting to access or modify an object that is null.

          - Example: myObject.method(); when myObject is null.

      2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
          - Cause: Trying to access an array element with an index outside its bounds.

          - Example: Accessing array[5] when array has only 5 elements (0-4).

      3. ArithmeticException
          - Performing illegal arithmetic operations, such as dividing by zero.

          - Example: int result = 10 / 0;

  Logic Errors: Mistakes in the program's logic that lead to incorrect output or behavior, even 
  though the code runs without crashes or syntax errors.

      1. Incorrect Operator Usage
          - Using == instead of .equals() to compare strings or objects.

          - Example: if (str == "hello") instead of if (str.equals("hello")).

      2.Off-by-One Errors
          - Common in loops, especially with for or while statements, leading to unintended bounds.

          - Example: for (int i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

      3.Wrong Conditional Logic
          - Using incorrect conditions in if, while, or for statements.

          - Example: if (x > 10 && x < 5) will always be false.

  Vulnerability: Weaknesses in a system or code that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized 
  access, cause disruptions, or extract sensitive information.+

      1.Logging or Printing Sensitive Information
          -Outputting sensitive data, such as passwords, personal information, or API keys, to logs or console output.

          -Example: System.out.println("Password: " + password);

      2. SQL Injection
          -Using unparameterized SQL queries, which can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

          -Example: String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'";

      3. Hardcoding Sensitive Data
          -Storing sensitive information (passwords, API keys) directly in source code.

          -Example: String apiKey = "API_SECRET_KEY";


How to Play:
Step 1: Answer a question and identify the type of error it describes.
Step 2: Fix the highlighted code and run it to match the expected output shown in the problem description.
Scoring:
Your score is based on:
Number of Attempts: Wrong answers reduce your score.
Time Taken: The faster you solve a problem, the more points you earn.
Be cautious! Selecting multiple wrong answers or taking too long will result in penalties. Accuracy and speed are key.

Types of Errors:
1. Compile-Time Errors
Errors detected by the compiler before the program runs. These are typically due to syntax mistakes or type mismatches.

1.1 Syntax Errors

Cause: Missing semicolons, braces, or parentheses.
Example:
java
Copy code
System.out.println("Hello World"
1.2 Class Not Found

Cause: Attempting to use a class that hasn’t been imported or doesn’t exist in the project.
Example:
java
Copy code
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
// Missing: import java.util.Scanner;
1.3 Type Mismatch

Cause: Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another incompatible type.
Example:
java
Copy code
int x = "Hello"; // String assigned to an int.
2. Runtime Errors/Exceptions
Errors that occur while the program is running, often due to invalid operations like dividing by zero or accessing array elements out of bounds.

2.1 NullPointerException

Cause: Attempting to access or modify an object that is null.
Example:
java
Copy code
myObject.method(); // myObject is null.
2.2 ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Cause: Accessing an array element using an index outside its bounds.
Example:
java
Copy code
int[] array = {1, 2, 3};
int
